### My Python practice 

### INTRODUCTION TO PROGRAMMING AND PYTHON 

## What is Programming
Programming is a way for us to tell computer whats you do. Computer is a very dumb machine
and its only does what we tell it to do.Hence we are learn programming and tell computers
to do what we are very slow at computation.If I ask you to calculate 1+1,you will immediately
say 2. How about 12345 X 6789 ?

## What is Python ?
Python is a dynamatically typed,gernal purpose programmming language thats supports an 
object-oriented programming apporach as well as a functional programming approach.
python is an interpreted ans a high-level-programming language.
It was created by Guido Van Rossum in 1989.

## What is Python used for
Python is used for Data Virtulization to create plots and graphical representations.
Python helps in Data Analytics to analyze and understand raw data for insights and trends.
It is used in AI and Machine Learning to simulate human behaviour and to learn from past
data without hard coding.

 ## What is python used for ?
 It is used to create web applications.
 It can be used to handle databases.
 It is used to perform buisness and accounting to perform complex mathmatical operations
 along with quantitative and quantitative analysis
